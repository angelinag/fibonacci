# Fibonacci
A canvas project I made when I was bored.
Click anywhere on the page and a magical fibonacci spiral will be created.
Made with html canvas and js.

TODO:
- refactoring
- click animation
- spiral appearing animation
- informational div with a close button which appears whenever the page is opened
